# Post Mortem

The Rust implementation (GDExtension) for this OctTree was unfortunately lost during a system migration, but the video below demonstrates the performance achieved (100k boids at 60fps).

## Lessons Learned & Architecture Decisions

- Architecture > Language: The language used doesn't matter nearly as much as the memory architecture. Flat arrays and direct UID/RID interactions with Godot's PhysicsServer and RenderingServer are the closest you can get to the metal, bypassing the overhead of the standard Node tree.

- The Godot-Rust "Sweet Spot": Rust is phenomenal for offloading heavy computational loops. However, it becomes a bottleneck if you try to deeply integrate with or replicate the engine's internal data structures (e.g., trying to set up an in-engine BVH is not worth the friction).

- Array-Backed Linked Lists: Transitioned away from traditional object-oriented collections (like C#'s List<T>) to pure index-based linked lists. By packing the node logic into just two integers (count and index) inside a flat array, and sorting the boid array every rebuild, sibling entities were kept perfectly contiguous in memory, eliminating pointer-chasing and cache misses.

- Prevented Boundary Thrashing (Loose Margins): Designed the OctTree with boundary overlap ("empty space") and a MaxElementCount per node. This allowed octants to dynamically and greedily encompass entire flocks, preventing the expensive CPU overhead of constantly re-assigning boids that hover on strict mathematical borders.

- Data-Oriented Design & Cache Locality: Achieved 100k boids by leveraging rayon for data-parallel multithreading over the flat arrays. Furthermore, implemented implicit AABBs—calculating bounds dynamically on the fly via integer math (Vector3i) from a single RootAABB rather than storing floats per-node. Combined with a coarse/fine grid where only leaf nodes handle positions, this drastically minimized the memory footprint and maximized CPU L1/L2 cache locality.
